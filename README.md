# A Custom New Tab Page

I hate Firefox's new tab page. This is my solution.

Includes Old School Runescape wiki search functionality because an estimated 80% of my Google searches begin with "osrs" followed by the thing i need to search for.

Things that I interact with the most are included in the sidebar panel, the most accessible side of my right monitor's screen. The bottom half of the screen is reserved for a list of content related to more hobby-centric content, websites, and resources.

Included is a set of quick links for news sites I frequent and a drop down menu for gmail accounts.
