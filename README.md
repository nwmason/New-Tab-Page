# A Custom New Tab Page

I hate Firefox's new tab page. This is my solution.

Includes Old School Runescape wiki search functionality because an estimated 80% of my Google searches begin with "osrs" followed by the thing i need to search for.

Things that I interact with the most are included in the sidebar panel, the most accessible side of my right monitor's screen. The bottom half of the screen is reserved for a list of content related to more hobby-centric content, websites, and resources.

The navbar's behavior is odd on purpose- it is how I tend to interact with my new tab page. Of course this isn't a good way to handle this in an actual setting- but for my own personal use it works as intended.
